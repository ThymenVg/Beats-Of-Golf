# <Beats of Golf Automation>

## Description

This application is developed to automate the startup of the needed software for golf simulators. You can use this application for other purposes aswell. It's functionality is not dedicated to golf simulator software.

- I started this project with a lot of excitement, I wanted to know if my coding knowledge is already usefull in real life scenarios.
- This project was developed as mentioned before for Beats of Golf, an indoor golf club located in Belgium.
- Because of this application employees have to spend less time making sure every simulator is up and running.
- During development I learned how to use windows API's in C# and use those API's to manipulate mouse inputs and tasks.
